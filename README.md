# TypingSoundsApp
Simple app that adds typing sounds to your Windows.
Developed and tested on Window 10 (2024).

## Config file
Config.txt located besides the executable. In config file you can change:
- selected preset
- volume level
- volume delta (from 0 to 100)
- pitch delta (from 0 to 2)

Volume delta and pitch delta is the deviation in sound that is picked randomly every key press to make sounds more unique.

## Custom presets
You can add custom sound presets. To do this you need:
- add folder with sounds (that will match with file names in default preset)
- choose it in config file (just write a folder name)
Note: files must be in a .WAV format.
